# Interact!
### A proof of concept social media app built with React.
Interact, or even better, **Inter(React)**, was built with the sole purpose of experimenting, learning and playing with React features, with a specific focus on React 16.8+. It's an important distinction as the whole app was built using functional components, hooks, useEffect and finally useContext for it's app wide state management. That's right... no Redux needed.




## What Interact is not...
Interact is NOT a production ready Twitter clone ready to take over the world. It does however possess most of the required features of a social media app; following friends, live chat, posting to walls, searching posts etc... 
With a bit of customization it can be an awesome little social media platform for friends or a small organization.

### The Backend (The part that's well... not in front.)
The backend is a no thrills nodeJS setup that points to a noSql server. As most of the logic is done in the front-end, even the live chat, you can figure out the backend by inspecting the API calls. If that all sounds like too much work, feel free to contact me for backend files.
